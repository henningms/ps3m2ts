created 2008-12-07 by madshi.net

this lib is based on pro_optimizer's (Christian Kothe) foobar2000 plugins
below you'll find the original description by Christian Kothe

Christian Kothe allowed me to use his code for eac3to under LGPL instead of GPL
this permission is limited to eac3to and does not extend to any other software
if you want to use libMatrix under LGPL, too, you'll have to contact C. Kothe

this lib uses the Fast Fourier Transform (FTW) functions by Takuya Ooura
